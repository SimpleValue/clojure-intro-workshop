# clojure introduction workshop

22.05.2013
Adcloud Gmbh


Doors open 16:30
Workshop 17:00 - 19:00

Free Drinks and BBQ afterwards.


## what you will learn

This will be a very pragmatic - hands on - workshop.
We will start with a short introduction (~30 minutes) to syntax and basic usage pattern, giving you the chance to ask questions.

After that we will encourage people to pair up and start working on our [example project](https://github.com/adcloud/clojure-intro-workshop).

In the last 30 min. you will be encouraged to present you solution.

We will finish with a BBQ, where you can talk with other attendees or continue on your project.


## what you will NOT learn

Given the limited amount of time and the zero prior knowledge character we can't explain philosophies, concepts and inner workings of things.
After the workshop you will be able to write code in clojure but will lack a deeper understanding.

If you like to dive deeper into the world of clojure here are a few knowledge sources:

- [Clojure Homepage](http://clojure.org/)
- [Clojure for Java Programmers](http://www.youtube.com/user/ClojureTV) by Rich Hickey (the inventor of clojure)
- [ClojureTV](http://www.youtube.com/user/ClojureTV) - Videos of Talks
- [Try Clojre](http://tryclj.com/) - try clojure in the bowser
- [Programming Clojure (2nd edition)](http://pragprog.com/book/shcloj2/programming-clojure) - Book
- [Clojure Documentation](http://clojure-doc.org/) - community driven documentation 
- [The Clojure Toolbox](http://www.clojure-toolbox.com/) - a list of projects by usecase


## please come prepared

Please make sure that you have the [basic project](https://github.com/adcloud/clojure-intro-workshop) forked and checked out on your machine.
Please consult the [project readme](https://github.com/adcloud/clojure-intro-workshop/blob/master/README.md) for details.


## about clojure

<quote>
Clojure is a dynamic programming language that targets the Java Virtual Machine (and the CLR, and JavaScript). It is designed to be a general-purpose language, combining the approachability and interactive development of a scripting language with an efficient and robust infrastructure for multithreaded programming. Clojure is a compiled language - it compiles directly to JVM bytecode, yet remains completely dynamic. Every feature supported by Clojure is supported at runtime. Clojure provides easy access to the Java frameworks, with optional type hints and type inference, to ensure that calls to Java can avoid reflection.

Clojure is a dialect of Lisp, and shares with Lisp the code-as-data philosophy and a powerful macro system. Clojure is predominantly a functional programming language, and features a rich set of immutable, persistent data structures. When mutable state is needed, Clojure offers a software transactional memory system and reactive Agent system that ensure clean, correct, multithreaded designs.
