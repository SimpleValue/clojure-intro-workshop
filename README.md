# Clojure Introduction Workshop

In this workshop, we program a game which [combines simple rules to
create complexity]((http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdMzngWchDk).
Modelled on life, its rules were inspired by birth, death and survival.

This repo contains:

- a starter-kit for programming the [Game of Life](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life).
- examples which you can mold.
